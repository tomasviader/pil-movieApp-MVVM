# PIL-MOBILE-MOVIE-APP

This project consists of a screen where is the title of the app, its description and two buttons. One of them is the "GET MOVIES" that is in charge of directing us to the second screen and the other one is the "ERROR BUTTON" that shows us a dialog error.

In the second screen there is a list of movies where each movie will have the corresponding data and characteristics. And there will also be a button at the top to go back to the first screen.

This project was developed using the Clean architecture, Room Database, Retrofit, Corrutinas and Koin.
