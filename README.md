# PIL-MOBILE-MOVIE-APP

The application is a simple user interface consisting of two main screens. The first screen displays the title of the application, a brief description and two buttons: "GET MOVIES" and "ERROR BUTTON". By clicking on the "GET MOVIES" button, the user is redirected to the second screen, which displays a list of movies with their respective data and characteristics. In addition, there is a button at the top to return to the first screen. The project has been developed using Clean, Room Database, Retrofit, Corrutinas and Koin architecture.
